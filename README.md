# Quantum Teleportation Using Qiskit & Cirq
This project demonstrates the implementation of quantum teleportation, a fundamental quantum communication protocol, using two leading quantum programming frameworks: Qiskit (IBM) and Cirq (Google).
The simulation shows how an arbitrary quantum state can be transmitted from one qubit to another using entanglement and classical communication, without physically moving the qubit itself.

ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s included:

Step-by-step teleportation circuit in Qiskit

Equivalent teleportation logic in Cirq

Visualizations of quantum states and measurement outcomes

Bloch sphere representation (optional)

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered:

Bell pair generation

Quantum measurement

Conditional gate operations using classical bits

Classical-quantum hybrid logic

ðŸ”¬ Prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of quantum computing

Python 3.x with qiskit and cirq installed
